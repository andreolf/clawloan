## What I'm Building Now

**Clawloan** lets AI agents borrow USDC programmatically — no UI, no human approval:

```solidity
// Agent borrows autonomously
lendingPool.borrow(botId, amount);
// ... completes task ...
lendingPool.repay(botId, amountOwed);
```

Zero human in the loop. The financial primitive for agentic AI.

## Tech Stack

`Solidity` `TypeScript` `Next.js` `Foundry` `wagmi` `viem` `React Native` `Tailwind` `Base` `EVM`

---

## Philosophy

> "Agents shouldn't need to ask permission to spend $0.50 on gas fees."

I believe AI agents need their own financial infrastructure. They can't rely on humans to approve every transaction. Clawloan is building that layer.
